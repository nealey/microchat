Î¼Chat
=====

It's an itty-bitty web chat,
for people who aren't trying to screw each other over.

It doesn't do a lot of checks, announcements, etc.
because it presumes nobody will be using it who is trying to make life hard on anyone else.

I wrote this at Cyber Fire Foundry 15
because we needed a minimal chat client,
but the only machine we had to run it on was our router.
